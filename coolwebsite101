                Romulus usually goes by Rom, because his full name is too serious for such a silly cat.
                Rom is a mackerel tabby. He is five years old, but he still loves to play like a kitten.
                If you don't keep your eye on Rom, he will lick the butter right off your toast.

                Bailey is a ginger and white tomcat. He is eight years old, and much more serious than Rom.
                But he still has bags of personality. He loves to eat green plants. If you bring home a
                bouquet of flowers, no matter what high shelf you put them on, Bailey will scheme for hours
                to work out a route to get at them.

                At age ten, Hugo is a senior cat and the animal shelter in Chicago was afraid he wouldn't
                get adopted. Luckily, he found a home with friends of ours, and has now moved with them
                to France. Hugo loves fancy French cat food, and he will meow loudly for his breakfast
                every morning.
